# Why this site exists

Remember when we had analog TV? Sometimes you would get weird artefacts on the screen from interference or reflection from nearby objects, called "ghosting".  This was really obvious even when you had tuned into white noise.  We're all surrounded by noise in today's world, so much so that a lot of the useful information goes missing unless you already know where to look.  This website hopes to be one of those sources, one of the "ghosts" in the noise, a light flickering through the interference in the hope that it's interesting to some.

# Who am I?

I'm a computer scientist by day, midnight engineer by... well, night -- or at least that's what I profess to be.  I have a passion for knowledge, teaching, and electronics -- particularly programmable hardware, 3D printing and UAVs.  In my spare time, I read books, try to sort the interesting news from the cruft on the Internet, play Civilisation, and work on projects of all shapes and sizes, none of them particularly notable (yet).  I enjoy board games and playing / listening to music, as well as skiing and sailing when I get the chance.  I helped start up [Kid Technic] in Canberra, to teach young children concepts in engineering and computing so that the next generation can become tech-literate too!

One of my New Year's Resolutions for 2015 was to write more, and this website is in part my aim to achieve this.  It mostly focuses on electronics and computing, but you'll also find the occasional thought on education and other bits too.
