<h1 class="post-title"> A Slightly Different Electronics Tutorial </h1>

Yep, it's true -- in order to qualify as a tech website of any reputation nowadays, you _must_ have an electronics tutorial of some kind for newcomers to get lost in and complain about.  Usually they are geared towards people who already have an electronics board and are looking for their next challenge, or start with the basics but forget that you probably don't know what half the parts are or do.  Still more hide all the interesting stuff away under heavily abstracted, sometimes strangely-named code (want to write an analog value with Arduino? `analogWrite()` is your friend, NOT!), which doesn't help you in the long run.


Something a lot of people struggle with is where to begin with programmable electronics, especially given that you usually start with nothing.  This tutorial does not aim to teach you about the core concepts of electronics -- there are already lots of excellent websites for that out there.  Instead, I want to focus on the practicalities of starting to play around with programmable digital circuits and how to do it _right_, or at least right enough to not make someone cringe when looking at your code.

The board I'm using to start off with is the well-known [Arduino™ UNO board], something that [quite a few people people] think is a bad idea for education.  Still, it's the most common, ubiquitous piece of educational electronics out there that's accessible to beginners right down to the core, and there is a huge amount of support and information surrounding it.  I aim to lead away from the "friendly" Arduino IDE pretty quickly, since the really interesting (and fun! No? Huh. Maybe I'm just weird) stuff happens behind the scenes.  

This won't replace enrolling in a course or degree in the surrounding fields of computer science and electronics, but it might help get your feet wet and give a more comfortable transition into the subject when the time comes.  Think of this tutorial as giving you the knowledge of a technician, but not that of an engineer.

So yeah, have yet another electronics tutorial -- one that's slightly different from the majority, and maybe _just_ interesting enough to have a go at it.


The tutorial so far:

1. [Starting Out: Where To Begin][start]
2. [Where Do I Buy Parts?][buy]
3. Installing Programs, and a Sane Programming Workflow -- still to come!
