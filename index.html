    Eh? Someone there?  Oh, I see I've been discovered!  Welcome, mysterious entity, to my little corner of the web.  Here you will find a log of my various musings, and perhaps something useful as well!
    </p>
    <p>
    A lot of what I have to write about has probably been covered by others before, but that is the way with these things -- there is so much information out there now, that it all gets lost in the noise...
    </p>

    <h1 class="page-heading">See what I've been writing about...</h1>

    <ul class="post-list">
        {% for post in site.posts %}
            <li>
                <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>
                <h2>
                    <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
                </h2>
            </li>
        {% endfor %}
