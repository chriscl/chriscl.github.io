This week we focused on ticking off the project objectives to make sure everything was ready to go -- in the end we managed to achieve nearly everything bar Cameron's NLP work.  The project review was quite full-on; I went in expecting to be done within 2 hours and walked out 4 hours later... The PMs did a pretty good job on keeping us on track and presenting the future-proofness of the project, however the overall demonstration was quite short and rushed due to lack of time.  I feel we all gave quite a bit of feedback and we showed off some of what we had done, but not as much as we will be doing at the showcase.  The documentation is basically there and the final framework seems to be working OK; still efficient enough to runs on Seb's Chromebook which I'm very surprised we could pull off.

The showcase demonstration is ready to go with perhaps some minor tweaking to use a Kinect camera instead of a webcam (since that's what we have at hand), but I'm pretty optimistic about it.
