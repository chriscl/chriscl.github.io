This week we held a meeting with the directors of the school on the 21st of April to discuss things that the Deane had asked us to discuss.  They recommended an academic champion on both the engineering and computer science side, which is definitely a good idea to keep this rolling after the year is over.  I've done some more exploration into CMU Sphinx; the tutorials seem to change every second week which is a little unnerving... Postmodern coding style at its finest!  I'll need to delve into the codebase to understand what's going on.  

Over the break we had a technical workshop to help Abbie design up the links between the various tasks we were working on.  It was nice to see the team working more together this time, and I hope that it continues.  We're definitely starting to communicate a little more.

The goal for this week is to get a simple coding example up and running using CMU Sphinx; here goes nothing!
