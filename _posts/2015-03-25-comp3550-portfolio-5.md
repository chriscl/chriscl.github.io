This week I came up with a very rough capability tree and dependency graph, and while I know there are lots of holes in the design it's what I've been able to get done this week with other assignments and responsibilities looming overhead.  We need to build a proper set of documentation with an architecture framework in place to help structure it.

# Capability Tree
The robot must have the following capabilities:

# Dependency Graph
What depends on what (open in a new tab to get full size image):

# Researching into NLP
I've been looking into using the Python Natural Langauge ToolKit as the basis for natural language processing.  I should be able to get it working with CMUSphinx (another Python framework) to transform speech into text, and get semantics information out of it to then do... something with. Not sure yet, need to think about it.  My only big concern is whether parsing language via Python will be quick enough to do the job properly.
