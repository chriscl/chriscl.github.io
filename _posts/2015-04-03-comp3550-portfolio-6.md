Well... I haven't updated this in a while, since life's been pretty busy.  I've self-nominated as poster designer for our project, since we need to get it done and I know just enough about graphic design to be dangerous!  There's still lots of paperwork and designing happening behind the scenes, but I haven't really had much of a part in it this week since I've been focusing on the poster.

Abbie has become the architect for the project after handing over my work on capabilities.  She's already plugged lots of holes in my design which is good, it means that we have a clearer picture of what to do now!

I decided to go with LaTeX as the poster medium because I know how to use it and I don't have to worry about layout design -- it does that for me!  Synchronisation via Git is easier too since the source is all in plain text.  The other members in my team have had a lot of great input and I'm confident we can get a good poster done despite not having anything really meaningful to show for our work over this term (planning and design work doesn't sell a poster or project very well).

# NLTK
On the project side, I've installed NLTK and tested it's working working with their provided corpus of knowledge.  It works well and gives good semantics information, only problem now is how to parse this semantic data and come up with an instruction generator.  I think that I need to talk to Cameron more about this before we start programming more seriously though.  Abbie mentioned that we should create a sequential diagram of how speech processing should act and perform, so I'll be working on that with Cameron this coming week and get more stuck into programming.  I'm still concerned we hadn't started designing all of this sooner, but then I don't think any of us really knew what we were getting ourselves into until now!
