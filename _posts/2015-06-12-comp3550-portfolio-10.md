The past couple of weeks of term have been pretty slow -- we've all become incredibly busy with other course work and exams, so we haven't done much.  The most we did in a meeting was discuss team names, something the PMs were quite focused on since apparently they were having a lot of difficulty explaining what our team did to potential people of an advisory board...

In the first week of the break Abbie and Greg held another technical workshop to help focus our work on some deadlines we'd like to achieve.  I'm worried that there won't be much interaction for the first part of this, since we all need to get our individual parts working first.  Integration should be relatively straightforward once each part is working, especially if we angle to get it built on something like ROS.  Something to look into over the break and beyond.
