I was quite sick for a week which didn't help with my progress on the project.  I'm getting a little worried that simply researching into mainstream language detection isn't going to lead towards any useful Australian-based dictionaries, since most models are trained with US pronunciations.  I'll have to try thresholding with a more complete dataset.

I stumbled across a newer and far more varied dataset from Wall Street Journal proceedings, which will hopefully improve accuracy a little bit once I start playing around with it.  It's quite likely I'll need to code up my own language model with the limited inputs that our robot can expect.
