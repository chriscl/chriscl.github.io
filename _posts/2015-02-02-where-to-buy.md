1. [Starting Out: What to Buy][starting]

This is part of my [slightly different electronics tutorial][asdet] series.


If you're coming from my previous article, you now have a list of parts, but if you're in the land down under (or many other countries for that matter) you likely don't have a decent electronics shop around the corner.  There are lots of different websites online that promise lowest prices _GUARANTEED_ on all items, but realistically there are only a few that do have that.  Here's a few places I've found which stock good products at the right price:

- [Adafruit][adafruit] has unique items and a huge supportive community, but be warned it is prohibitively expensive to ship from them outside the Americas, and likely not worth it.

- [Sparkfun][sparkfun] "is an online retail store that sells the bits and pieces to make your electronics projects possible" (from their description).  Another online store with a wealth of unique products that aren't really produced anywhere else.  Shipping overseas is reasonable too.

- [SeeedStudio][seeed] has a large selection of boards and parts, some of which are well suited to specific applications.  Shipping is free when buying over US$50 worth of equipment from them.

- [Ali Express][aliexpress] is an online retail service owned by the Alibaba group.  Think of it as an online market for small Chinese businesses selling to foreign countries.  You often cannot get a lower price for parts than on here, but it should go without saying that you should trust long-term, top-rated sellers over others on here.

# Doesn't Australia have resellers for these sites?

Well yes, there are some - and there are resellers for other suppliers too.  Nearly everything is still produced in China though, and anything that isn't is still cheaper to get from its source. If you can buy it from the people that make it, it'll generally be much cheaper since there are no third parties that need to make their profit.

# I don't know which parts or kit to choose!

You're probably safest choosing [one of these][starterkit] off Ali Express then.  It has everything you'll need to begin with, and isn't too pricey either.
