This week has mostly been about wrestling with OS libraries to get sound working across the hardware I have at hand.  In the end I've given up and have purchased two USB microphones that are due to arrive before the ANU Open day, in order to fix the issue and have a reliable connection.  For the moment I'm sticking with PyAudio and recording for short intervals to process on, but eventually I'd really like to get a GStreamer approach up and running since it would work in real-time as opposed to delayed by X seconds.

We've all made a positive step forward to fixing the engineering environment problems pointed out last week, and are all pushing more frequently and on different branches.  I'm somewhat annoyed that Magic's work in the main branch is still non-functional but at least we have a step in the right direction.

Seb's made a great effort in documentation and I hope to add to that as time permits.  So far I've started documenting the code and will work on getting a build script for a physical and virtual machine I have planned (so we have some stable hardware to work on at last).
