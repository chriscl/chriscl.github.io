Team Formation Day was a resounding success -- it seems that we have a solid team who is interested in the project and are happy to rise to the challenge!  We somehow managed to rope in two other interested third years and two fourth years as project managers.  We originally had one PM, but she thought that a project of this size and possible scope needed more work than one person could achieve and found a scond person to help her.  All in all, we now have a 7 person team in TechLauncher with a few people outside helping out where they can too.  Unfortunately our availabilities are such that we can only meet on Friday week 4.

I've been looking into courses on machine learning and it seems like it's time to jump on the Statistical Machine Learning bandwagon at ANU!  I'm somewhat worried about its reputation as one of the hardest undergraduate courses on offer, but I know that it will be worth it and help a lot with the training and testing of algorithms in this project.
