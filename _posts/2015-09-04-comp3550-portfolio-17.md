Given the number of hours I spent last week on this project I've taken a step back and worked on updating my portfolio instead.  The open day went quite well apparently, though there was a problem with the noisy environment and speech detection.  They kept needing to change the amplification value of the microphone in order to reliably pick up the speech through the noise! I will have to add in a second noise cancelling microphone into the speech detection module before the year is over to remedy this.

In the meeting the PMs got me to switch from working on Speech to working on Control modules -- a welcome change since it's been what I've wanted to work on since the beginning of the project...  I'm feeling a bit more positive now that we've managed to pull off a working integrated demonstration, and I'm hoping to move everything over to ROS after the break.  Time to read up on adaptive control finally.
