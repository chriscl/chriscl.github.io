I've managed to get a basic demo of pocketsphinx up and running, simply listening to everything for now.  The American-based dictionary is pretty terrible at picking up words that are pronounced differently -- looks like I'll need to manually edit the language model and dictionary to get around this.

We've been refactoring the requirements of the system to get a clearer picture of a simple minimum product that we can aim towards.  Lots of talk about coding styles and documentation too.  I believe it's a good step forward, but I'm not sure how ready we are to generate full documentation of the system -- especially since we've been researching in the different areas up until now, not generating much code.

Jess forwarded me on an email about text to speech libraries which will hopefully become useful.  I feel that that's an easy part to achieve in the grand scheme of things though, and computing the other way round will be a little more challenging to get right.
