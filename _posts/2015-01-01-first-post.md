Well, hello to whoever reaches this website!  I've been wanting to set one up for a long time now, however every time I looked to see what was out there so far, there seemed to be only two solutions: write your own HTML/Markdown pages and lay everything out yourself, or go for a heavyweight blog system like Wordpress complete with databases, caching and all sorts of other things to go wrong.

Maybe I was just caught in my own search bubble, but I only recently found out about Jekyll and its brethren static site generators in other languages.  It's pretty refreshing to find a site framework that's simple at its core.  I like the automation that gets out of my way to let me concentrate on what I really want to do (i.e. not muck around with databases and PHP for such a small site).  The fact I can get free hosting from GitHub for it is an added bonus, and I'm very grateful for that.

In any case, this website's more or less a way to help me write more, since I'm losing that ability through disuse.  I aim to put up a few useful ideas here and there so that I can avoid repeating myself or forgetting things; hopefully you can find something of use amidst my rambling.  To start with, I'll mostly be writing about electronics and computing, since that's what I study, but I hope I have some thoughts to write up on education soon, as well as a few other bits and pieces.

My website is not fully set up yet, but if I wait until it's to my liking, it may never go live given lack of time.  So, here goes nothing...!
